 
OpenCalphad is a free thermodynamic software for calculation of multicomponent equilibria, property and phase diagrams and for database development.  It has a simple command line interface and an Application Software Interface (OCASI) for integration in simulation software. For simulations it can calculate equilibria in parallel using OpenMP.
The stable version can be downloaded from http://opencalphad.org either as a zip file or as a precompiled installation for Windows.

A third party Graphic User Interface (GUI) of OpenCalphad (named as OpenCalphad CAE) for Windows can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/48dqcsk861dmulg/AAC7tcrUVLxYOFVF7GIkJ4UVa?dl=0).

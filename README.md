# Introduction
This website gives the possibility to use OpenCalphad using a virtual machine. In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system.  The virtual machine of OpenCalphad was designed to run on the platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux. It uses the host software of the VirtualBox project, which is has the GNU Licensing.

## 3. Open image file
After the download of the image file of the virtual machine, the files need to be uncompressed. The image is compressed with the regular ZIP compression format. It can be uncompressed with software, like Winzip or Winrar. The "debian-oc.vdi" file is the main file, which will be opened using virtualbox. This will result in the following screenshot (screenshot #3).
